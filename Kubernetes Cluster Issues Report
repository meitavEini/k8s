# Kubernetes Cluster Issues Report

## Summary
During the deployment of WordPress on the Kubernetes cluster, I encountered several technical issues related to node availability and pod creation. These issues prevented me from successfully completing the exercise.

## Observations

### 1. Node Issues
- **All nodes in the cluster are in a `NotReady` state.**
- This is a critical issue because nodes in `NotReady` cannot schedule new pods.
- The output of `kubectl get nodes` confirms that all nodes are `NotReady` (as seen in the attached screenshot).

### 2. Pod Issues
- **Pods remain stuck in `Pending` or `Terminating` states.**
- As seen in `kubectl get pods -n ns-meitavi`, multiple pods were unable to start due to node issues.
- Example pods affected: `wordpress-99555d88-6scmq`, `meitav-ingress-controller`, and `meitav-prometheus-kube-prometheus-admission-create`.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis
- Since the nodes are `NotReady`, Kubernetes cannot assign pods to them.
- The cluster is unable to create new resources properly.
- This likely stems from an infrastructure issue within the managed Kubernetes cluster.

## Conclusion
This is primarily a **node availability issue**, which cascades into problems with pod scheduling. Until the nodes transition to `Ready` status, deploying any resources will continue to fail. Fixing the underlying cluster health is necessary before proceeding with the exercise.

Cluster Issues
Node Status Issue
The cluster experienced issues with nodes that were unavailable:
